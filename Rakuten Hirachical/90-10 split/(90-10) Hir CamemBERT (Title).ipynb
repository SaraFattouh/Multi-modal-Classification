This library contains interfaces for other pretrained language models.\n","\n","We’ve selected the pytorch interface because it strikes a nice balance between the high-level APIs (which are easy to use but don’t provide insight into how things work) and tensorflow code (which contains lots of details but often sidetracks us into lessons about tensorflow, when the purpose here is BERT!).\n","\n","At the moment, the Hugging Face library seems to be the most widely accepted and powerful pytorch interface for working with BERT. In addition to supporting a variety of different pre-trained transformer models, the library also includes pre-built modifications of these models suited to your specific task.\n","E.g \"BertForSequenceClassification\" that we will be using."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EK890k2AFjSq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619698743076,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":20204,"user":{"displayName":"Sara Fattouh","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjGrdvZo2x_8K8abskRubIgMK3SdtS4cG-aQE01nA=s64","userId":"09360594903764573322"}},"outputId":"7e1993f0-9576-4d45-e292-05ce66c38a17"},"source":["!pip install transformers\n","!pip install sentencepiece\n"],"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting transformers\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d8/b2/57495b5309f09fa501866e225c84532d1fd89536ea62406b2181933fb418/transformers-4.5.1-py3-none-any.whl (2.1MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 2.1MB 4.2MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata; python_version < \"3.8\" in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (3.10.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (2019.12.20)\n","Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (3.0.12)\n","Collecting sacremoses\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/75/ee/67241dc87f266093c533a2d4d3d69438e57d7a90abb216fa076e7d475d4a/sacremoses-0.0.45-py3-none-any.whl (895kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 901kB 47.0MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hCollecting tokenizers<0.11,>=0.10.1\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ae/04/5b870f26a858552025a62f1649c20d29d2672c02ff3c3fb4c688ca46467a/tokenizers-0.10.2-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (3.3MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 3.3MB 53.7MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: packaging in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (20.9)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.27 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (4.41.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.23.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.19.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.6.4; python_version < \"3.8\" in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from importlib-metadata; python_version < \"3.8\"->transformers) (3.7.4.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: zipp>=0.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from importlib-metadata; python_version < \"3.8\"->transformers) (3.4.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: click in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from sacremoses->transformers) (7.1.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from sacremoses->transformers) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: joblib in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from sacremoses->transformers) (1.0.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from packaging->transformers) (2.4.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: chardet<4,>=3.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.0.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<3,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2020.12.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3!=1.25.0,!=1.25.1,<1.26,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.24.3)\n","Installing collected packages: sacremoses, tokenizers, transformers\n","Successfully installed sacremoses-0.0.45 tokenizers-0.10.2 transformers-4.5.1\n","Collecting sentencepiece\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f5/99/e0808cb947ba10f575839c43e8fafc9cc44e4a7a2c8f79c60db48220a577/sentencepiece-0.1.95-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (1.2MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 1.2MB 4.3MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: sentencepiece\n","Successfully installed sentencepiece-0.1.95\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6wKDUqYCNQnq"},"source":["# 2.
