Installing the Hugging Face Library\n","\n","Install the transformers package from Hugging Face which will give us a pytorch interface for working with BERT. This library contains interfaces for other pretrained language models.\n","\n","We’ve selected the pytorch interface because it strikes a nice balance between the high-level APIs (which are easy to use but don’t provide insight into how things work) and tensorflow code (which contains lots of details but often sidetracks us into lessons about tensorflow, when the purpose here is BERT!).\n","\n","At the moment, the Hugging Face library seems to be the most widely accepted and powerful pytorch interface for working with BERT. In addition to supporting a variety of different pre-trained transformer models, the library also includes pre-built modifications of these models suited to your specific task.\n","E.g \"BertForSequenceClassification\" that we will be using."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EK890k2AFjSq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619768020031,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":19685,"user":{"displayName":"Sara Fattouh","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjGrdvZo2x_8K8abskRubIgMK3SdtS4cG-aQE01nA=s64","userId":"09360594903764573322"}},"outputId":"9371c0e0-6739-488b-81d8-aefb581db3e1"},"source":["!pip install transformers\n","!pip install sentencepiece\n"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting transformers\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d8/b2/57495b5309f09fa501866e225c84532d1fd89536ea62406b2181933fb418/transformers-4.5.1-py3-none-any.whl (2.1MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 2.1MB 15.8MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (3.0.12)\n","Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (2019.12.20)\n","Collecting sacremoses\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/75/ee/67241dc87f266093c533a2d4d3d69438e57d7a90abb216fa076e7d475d4a/sacremoses-0.0.45-py3-none-any.whl (895kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 901kB 53.2MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.27 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (4.41.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.23.0)\n","Collecting tokenizers<0.11,>=0.10.1\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ae/04/5b870f26a858552025a62f1649c20d29d2672c02ff3c3fb4c688ca46467a/tokenizers-0.10.2-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (3.3MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 3.3MB 58.5MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata; python_version < \"3.8\" in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (3.10.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (20.9)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.19.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from sacremoses->transformers) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: joblib in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from sacremoses->transformers) (1.0.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: click in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from sacremoses->transformers) (7.1.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<3,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3!=1.25.0,!=1.25.1,<1.26,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.24.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2020.12.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: chardet<4,>=3.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.0.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: zipp>=0.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from importlib-metadata; python_version < \"3.8\"->transformers) (3.4.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.6.4; python_version < \"3.8\" in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from importlib-metadata; python_version < \"3.8\"->transformers) (3.7.4.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from packaging->transformers) (2.4.7)\n","Installing collected packages: sacremoses, tokenizers, transformers\n","Successfully installed sacremoses-0.0.45 tokenizers-0.10.2 transformers-4.5.1\n","Collecting sentencepiece\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f5/99/e0808cb947ba10f575839c43e8fafc9cc44e4a7a2c8f79c60db48220a577/sentencepiece-0.1.95-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (1.2MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 1.2MB 14.2MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: sentencepiece\n","Successfully installed sentencepiece-0.1.95\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6wKDUqYCNQnq"},"source":["# 2.

Son dessus de table en bois massif est idéal pour ranger vos boissons panier de fruits ou objets décoratifs et sa base en acier solide ajoute à la robustesse de la table d'appoint. La table basse est faite de bois de récupération massif provenant de solives de planchers et de poutres de soutien de vieux bâtiments en cours de démolition et peut être composée de différents types de bois comme le Sesham (bois de rose) le pin le teck le hêtre le chêne le cèdre le bois de manguier l'acacia etc. Cela signifie que le bois de récupération conserve les caractéristiques de ces différents types de bois. Le bois récupéré est déjà vieilli patiné et séché de sorte qu'il ne rétrécit pas ne se plie pas et n'a pas besoin d'une finition. Chaque étape du processus est réalisée avec le plus grand soin que ce soit le ponçage la peinture ou le laquage. Les belles fibres de bois rendent chaque meuble unique et légèrement différent du suivant. Les signes d'usure et la structure fibreuse visible donnent à chaque pièce son histoire et un aspect unique. L'article est déjà assemblé ; aucun assemblage n'est requis. Remarque importante : les couleurs varient d'un meuble à l'autre rendant chacune de nos tables basses unique la livraison est aléatoire.
