Son dessus de table en bois massif est idéal pour ranger vos boissons panier de fruits ou objets décoratifs et sa base en acier solide ajoute à la robustesse de la table d'appoint. La table basse est faite de bois de récupération massif provenant de solives de planchers et de poutres de soutien de vieux bâtiments en cours de démolition et peut être composée de différents types de bois comme le Sesham (bois de rose) le pin le teck le hêtre le chêne le cèdre le bois de manguier l'acacia etc. Cela signifie que le bois de récupération conserve les caractéristiques de ces différents types de bois. Le bois récupéré est déjà vieilli patiné et séché de sorte qu'il ne rétrécit pas ne se plie pas et n'a pas besoin d'une finition. Chaque étape du processus est réalisée avec le plus grand soin que ce soit le ponçage la peinture ou le laquage. Les belles fibres de bois rendent chaque meuble unique et légèrement différent du suivant. Les signes d'usure et la structure fibreuse visible donnent à chaque pièce son histoire et un aspect unique. L'article est déjà assemblé ; aucun assemblage n'est requis. Remarque importante : les couleurs varient d'un meuble à l'autre rendant chacune de nos tables basses unique la livraison est aléatoire.
